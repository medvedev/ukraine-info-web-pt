Hi! Thank you for your curiosity.
I'm a ukrainian who uses this way to share the word about my country, the war that Russia started against my Homeland.
----
Some people think that the war started in 2022. It's not true. It started with the annexation of Crimea (started on 20.02.2014, i.e. more than 8 years ago). For more details you can check a wikipedia page about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War'>The Russo-Ukrainian war</a>

It's easy to say “Putin invaded Ukraine”. But the truth is: The whole Russia, not “Putin” alone invaded. Country that has 140M of population, and at least 2M of them work hard almost every day to kill more ukrainians and achieve Russia's goal: destroy Ukraine and the whole Ukrainian nation. Putin, as any other political leader, is a product of his society.
----
The word “Peace” is very popular in 2022. But how exactly can you imagine the peace? There's no way to have a "peace" with a criminal without a justice. You probably would not "just a peace" with a person who killed and\or raped your loved ones, destroyed your house etc. You'll need a revenge or at least a justice. And the first thing is to put this person in a jail, so no more harm will be made.
----
Unfortunately, it's not possible to put the whole of Russia to jail. But the world can be consistent in helping Ukraine to defend itself and in the sanctions applied to Russia through citizens of Russia, companies of Russia, officials of Russia etc.
As you can see now, Russia does not want “money” or “territory” from Ukraine. It wants to destroy Ukraine, in the most cruel and barbarian way. Think of it next time you'll read or hear “Peace”.
----
Other popular phrases are “No war” and “Stop war”. If Ukraine stops the war by giving up fighting, Ukraine will not exist any more. If the warzone is frozen today, the territory larger than area of Portugal remains under Russia's control.
The only one way to stop the war is to stop Russia, make it leave all the territories it conquired since 2014, make all the war criminals stand in front of the judges and make Russia pay reparations to Ukraine.

Ukrainians are brave people who fight for their homeland. They want war to be over more than anybody else. And they know that the war can and should be over when every single Ukrainian can safely return back home. While Russia has a chance to fire a new rocket to Ukraine's land, this return cannot happen.
